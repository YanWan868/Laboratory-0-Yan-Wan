To build a project, you should create a new repository to store our code , images, notes and documents. It’s kind of like a folder stored in the cloud, you can also think of it as a “remote repository”. As long as you allow it, anyone can view and download the stuff stored there. At the same time, it keeps a revision history of every document, so you can check it at any time.

## Git bash
Firstly, I download the gitbash and register it with my name and email.

## Cloning
Secondly, after registering it, if you want to clone a repo in github. Open the folder where you want to download the repository. Copy the HTTPS link from GitHub, then use git clone command to clone it.
