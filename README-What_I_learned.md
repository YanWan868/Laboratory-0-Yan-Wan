(Honestly, it's not my first time to use github, but it's my first time to explore in github! (*^▽^*))

To build a project, you should create a new repository to store our code , images, notes and documents. It’s kind of like a folder stored in the cloud, you can also think of it as a “remote repository”. As long as you allow it, anyone can view and download the stuff stored there. At the same time, it keeps a revision history of every document, so you can check it at any time.

## Git bash
Firstly, I download the gitbash and register it with my name and email.
